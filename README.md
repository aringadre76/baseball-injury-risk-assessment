## API Usage

### Basic Pitcher Assessment
```python
from src.injury_risk_scorer import AdvancedRiskScorer

# Initialize risk scorer
scorer = AdvancedRiskScorer()

# Analyze a pitcher
risk_profile = scorer.analyze_pitcher_risk("1031_2")

print(f"Overall Risk: {risk_profile['overall_injury_risk']:.1f}/100")
print(f"UCL Risk: {risk_profile['ucl_injury_risk']:.1f}/100") 
print(f"Shoulder Risk: {risk_profile['shoulder_injury_risk']:.1f}/100")
print(f"Risk Category: {risk_profile['risk_category']}")
```

### Temporal Feature Extraction
```python
from src.temporal_feature_extractor import extract_pitcher_temporal_features

# Extract 108 temporal features
features = extract_pitcher_temporal_features("1031_2")

print(f"Extracted {len(features)} temporal features")
print(f"Phase timing: {features['total_pitch_duration']:.3f}s")
print(f"Kinetic chain efficiency: {features.get('proper_kinetic_sequence', 'N/A')}")
```

### Batch Processing
```python
from src.temporal_feature_extractor import batch_extract_temporal_features
from src.injury_risk_scorer import batch_analyze_pitcher_risks

# Process multiple pitchers
pitcher_ids = ["1031_2", "1031_3", "1097_1"]

# Extract features
features_df = batch_extract_temporal_features(pitcher_ids)

# Assess risks  
risk_df = batch_analyze_pitcher_risks(pitcher_ids)

print(f"Processed {len(risk_df)} pitchers")
print(f"Average risk: {risk_df['overall_injury_risk'].mean():.1f}/100")
```

| **Elbow Varus Moment** | UCL stress indicator | High values → UCL injury risk |
| **Shoulder IR Moment** | Rotator cuff stress | Excessive → shoulder injury |
| **Max Shoulder IR Velocity** | Overuse indicator | High velocity → wear/tear |
| **Hip-Shoulder Separation** | Kinetic chain efficiency | Poor separation → arm stress |
| **Phase Timing** | Movement coordination | Poor timing → injury risk |
| **Force Development** | Lower body contribution | Inadequate → upper body compensation |
